# 🚀 DevOps Log Monitor

![CI Pipeline](https://github.com/charithareddymule/devops-log-monitor/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A lightweight DevOps-style log monitoring tool built with Python.  
This project demonstrates how automated testing, linting, and CI pipelines are used to maintain code quality in real-world DevOps workflows.

## 📌 Project Overview

In production systems, logs are critical for monitoring application health.  
This project simulates a **log monitoring utility** that:

- Reads application logs from a file
- Counts log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Ensures correctness through automated tests
- Enforces coding standards using linting
- Runs fully automated CI using GitHub Actions

All development and automation are done **entirely on GitHub**.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📄 Reads and analyzes real log files
- 📊 Counts INFO, WARNING, and ERROR logs
- 🧪 Unit testing using `pytest`
- 🧹 Code linting using `flake8`
- 🔁 Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Quality gates: tests + lint must pass before success
